⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️

The plugin was moved to the official Pelican plugin organization.

You can now find it here: https://github.com/pelican-plugins/minify

Also the package name changed to `pelican-minify`. Please read the docs.

























**Note that the plugin name changed to ``pelican.plugins.minification`` with version 1.0.0!**

Content minification for the `Pelican`_ site generator.
This plugin can compress HTML & CSS files as well as inline CSS and JavaScript in HTML files.


Installation and Usage
----------------------

pelican-minification depends on the following packages that will be installed automatically, see below:

* `htmlmin`_
* `csscompressor`_
* `jsmin`_
* `BeautifulSoup`_
* `Pelican`_


Install pelican-minification into your Python interpreter using pip:

.. code-block:: shell

    pip install pelican-minification


Then add the plugin to the ``PLUGINS`` setting within your *pelicanconf.py*:

.. code-block:: python

    PLUGINS = [
        ...
        'pelican.plugins.minification',
    ]

Upon calling the *pelican* command now, all HTML and CSS files are compressed automatically;
including inline JavaScript and CSS rules in ``<script>`` and ``<style>`` tags.

To configure the behavior of the plugin, add the following variables in your *pelicanconf.py*
(here are the default values):

.. code-block:: python

    CSS_MIN = True
    HTML_MIN = True
    INLINE_CSS_MIN = True
    INLINE_JS_MIN = True

Please note that ``INLINE_CSS_MIN`` and ``INLINE_JS_MIN`` require ``HTML_MIN`` be enabled.
